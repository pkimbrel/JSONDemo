# JSON Demo

This demonstrates how to write functions out to JSON.  

writeJSON.js will write out "data.json" which will take a standard JavaScript object and serialize the functions to strings.

'node src/writeJSON.js'

readJSON.js will read the "data.json" which and will deserialize the functions back into the original form.

'node src/readJSON/js'
